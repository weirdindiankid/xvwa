                    <p align="justify">
                      The application is always available at <a href="http://cumm111-b17stat01.bu.edu/xvwa/">http://cumm111-b17stat01.bu.edu/xvwa/</a>   
                    </p>

                        You can login using any of the credentials below <br><br>
                        <code>
                        admin:admin <br>
                        xvwa:xvwa <br>
                        user:vulnerable 
                    </code>
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        If, for some reason, you are unable to login using the credentials provided above, it's likely a classmate has successfully completed all or part of assignment 5. In this case, you will need to reset the application to its default state. To do so, go to <a href="http://cumm111-b17stat01.bu.edu/xvwa/setup">http://cumm111-b17stat01.bu.edu/xvwa/setup</a> and click on the "Submit/Reset" button.

                        <strong>Important Warning</strong><br>
                        Do not host this application on live or production environment. XVWA is a mind-numbingly vulnerable application and giving online/live access of this application could lead to complete compromise of your system. Only students enrolled in the Spring 2021 iteration of Boston University's CS 501 T1 are allowed to access this system. All other use is prohibited.
                    </p>
